BSP layer, and booting the images generated in build directory.

I. Building the meta-engicam BSP layer
========================================

In order to build an image with BSP support for a given release, you
need to download the corresponding tools described in the "Dependencies"
section. Be sure that everything is in the same directory.

	$ mkdir yocto; cd yocto
	~/yocto $ git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
	~/yocto $ git clone https://github.com/chakradivi/meta-engicam.git

Then you need to source the configuration script:

	~/yocto $ source poky/oe-init-build-env

Now you can build an image for a engicam boards by adding the location 
of the meta-engicam layer to bblayers.conf, along with any other layers
needed (to access common metadata shared between BSPs)

To enable the build for a specific board, add its name in the MACHINE variable
to local.conf:

	MACHINE ?= "icorem6"

All supported machines can be found in meta-engicam/conf/machine.

You should then be able to build a image as such:

	~/yocto/build $ bitbake core-image-minimal

At the end of a successful build, you should have an image in

	tmp/deploy/images/$(MACHINE)/


II. Booting the images 
========================

--- replace with specific instructions for your platform ---

This BSP contains bootable live images, which can be used to directly
boot Yocto off of a USB flash drive.

Under Linux, insert a USB flash drive.  Assuming the USB flash drive
takes device /dev/sdf, use dd to copy the live image to it.  For
example:

# dd if=core-image-minimal-xxxx.wic of=/dev/sdf
# sync
# eject /dev/sdf

This should give you a bootable USB flash device.  Insert the device
into a bootable USB socket on the target, and power on.  This should
result in a system booted to the Sato graphical desktop.

If you want a terminal, use the arrows at the top of the UI to move to
different pages of available applications, one of which is named
'Terminal'.  Clicking that should give you a root terminal.

If you want to ssh into the system, you can use the root terminal to
ifconfig the IP address and use that to ssh in.  The root password is
empty, so to log in type 'root' for the user name and hit 'Enter' at
the Password prompt: and you should be in.

----

If you find you're getting corrupt images on the USB (it doesn't show
the syslinux boot: prompt, or the boot: prompt contains strange
characters), try doing this first:

# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdf bs=1M count=512

III. Board Testing Status
==========================

1. icorem6:
   i.MX6 Quad/Dual/Solo/DualLite SOMs
   - Boot from MMC, OK
   - Boot from NAND, OK
   - Ethernet, OK

2. icorem6rqs
   i.MX6 Quad/Dual/Solo/DualLite SOMs
   - For Solo/DualLite, build u-boot "make DEVICE_TREE=imx6dl-icore-rqs" since
     SPL is not picking up the correct DTB, but if deevice tree is hardcoded it's, OK
   - Boot from MMC, OK
   - Boot from eMMC, OK
   - Ethernet, NotOK

3. i.CoreM6 1.5 MIPI
   i.MX6 Quad/Dual/Solo/DualLite 1.5 SOMs
   - Boot from MMC, OK
   - Boot from eMMC, OK
   - Ethernet, NotOK
	
3. isiot - issue while booting kernel
   i.MX6UL eMMC/NAND SOMs
   - Boot from MMC, OK
   - Boot from eMMC, OK
   - Boot from NAND, OK
   - Ethernet, NotOK
	
4. geam6ul - issue in uboot
   i.MX6UL SOMs
   - Boot from MMC, OK
   - Boot from NAND, OK
   - Ethernet, NotOK
